## The Problem with Most AI Strategies

We've reviewed hundreds of AI strategies over the past three years. The pattern is consistent: long lists of use-cases, vague promises of "transformation," and technology roadmaps that read like vendor brochures.

**The missing piece? A clear line of sight to P&L impact.**

Boards and CFOs don't fund AI for its own sake. They fund it when you can answer three questions:
1. How much value is at stake?
2. What will it cost to capture it?
3. How quickly will we see results?

## The 90-Day AI Portfolio Framework

Here's the approach we use with clients to move from AI enthusiasm to board-approved budgets:

### Week 1-2: Value Discovery

**Goal**: Quantify the prize across your business.

Activities:
- Map business processes and pain points
- Size the opportunity (revenue, cost, risk)
- Identify quick wins vs. transformational plays
- Benchmark against competitors and best practices

**Output**: Value tree with $X–$Y at stake by area (e.g., $15M–$25M in marketing personalization, $8M–$12M in supply chain optimization).

### Week 3-4: Use-Case Prioritization

**Goal**: Build a portfolio balanced for value, feasibility, and speed.

We score each use-case on:
- **Value at stake** (high/medium/low)
- **Data readiness** (0-10)
- **Technical complexity** (low/medium/high)
- **Organizational readiness** (change required)
- **Time to impact** (weeks/months/quarters)

**Output**: Prioritized backlog with 3-5 "lighthouses" (high-value, feasible, fast) and 8-12 "bets" for subsequent waves.

### Week 5-6: Business Case Development

**Goal**: Turn the portfolio into an investment thesis.

For each lighthouse use-case:
- Detailed P&L impact model (revenue lift, cost savings, risk reduction)
- Cost to build (data, models, integration, change management)
- Timeline and milestones
- Success metrics and governance

**Output**: Board-ready business case with clear ROI, payback period, and risk mitigation.

### Week 7-10: Proof of Concept

**Goal**: De-risk the top 2-3 use-cases with working prototypes.

Build:
- Minimum viable models on real data
- Simple UX/dashboards to demonstrate value
- Pilot results with actual users
- Scale roadmap and operating model

**Output**: Working POCs, pilot results, and confidence to proceed to production.

### Week 11-12: Operating Model & Roadmap

**Goal**: Define how you'll deliver AI at scale.

Design:
- AI center of excellence or federated model
- Data and ML platform architecture
- Talent and skills plan
- Governance and responsible AI framework
- 18-month rollout roadmap

**Output**: Executable roadmap with budget, team, and milestones.

## Real-World Example: Financial Services

A regional bank came to us with a list of 40 AI ideas. After the 90-day sprint:

**Value quantified**: $45M–$65M over 3 years  
**Lighthouse use-cases**: 4 (fraud detection, personalized offers, credit underwriting, call deflection)  
**Board approval**: $12M investment in year 1  
**POC results**: Fraud detection model caught 35% more fraud than rules-based system in pilot

The difference? We led with the money, not the models.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting with technology**: "Let's buy a GenAI platform" is backwards. Start with the business problem.
2. **Ignoring data reality**: 60% of AI failure is data quality/availability. Assess this first.
3. **Underestimating change**: AI without process/org change is shelfware.
4. **Lack of governance**: Responsible AI isn't a nice-to-have—it's risk management.
5. **No lighthouse wins**: You need proof points to sustain momentum and funding.

## The Bottom Line

**AI strategy is business strategy.** The goal isn't to deploy models—it's to capture value faster than competitors.

A disciplined 90-day portfolio approach gives you:
- Quantified business cases CFOs approve
- Lighthouse wins that build momentum
- An operating model that scales
- A roadmap the organization can execute
