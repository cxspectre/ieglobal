## The Challenge

A global telecom provider was losing ground in digital channels:
- **Crude segmentation**: Only 4 broad customer segments
- **Poor conversion**: Ecommerce conversion rates below industry benchmarks
- **Irrelevant offers**: Customers receiving products they'd never buy
- **Declining engagement**: Digital channel usage stagnating

Leadership knew personalization was the answer—but traditional segmentation approaches weren't granular enough to drive meaningful lift.

## Our Approach

We delivered an end-to-end hyper-personalization program:

### 1. Needs-Based Segmentation (Weeks 1-5)
- Analyzed customer behavior across 50+ attributes
- Conducted quantitative surveys with 5,000+ customers
- Built needs-based segmentation framework
- Identified 60 micro-segments with distinct value propositions

### 2. ML-Driven Targeting (Weeks 6-9)
- Developed propensity models for product categories
- Created real-time recommendation engine
- Integrated with web and mobile platforms
- A/B testing framework for continuous optimization

### 3. UX & Ecommerce Optimization (Weeks 10-14)
- Redesigned product discovery flows
- Personalized homepages by segment
- Streamlined checkout process
- Mobile-first responsive design

### 4. Campaign Orchestration (Weeks 15-18)
- Mapped customer journeys for each segment
- Built automated campaign workflows
- Integrated email, SMS, push, and web channels
- Real-time decisioning for next-best-offer

## The Results

**$20M+ annual value** identified at stake through improved conversion and upsell.

**2× conversion rate** improvement on targeted product categories.

**6× CTR uplift** on personalized campaigns vs. generic blasts.

**60 distinct micro-segments** enabling unprecedented relevance.

## Key Insights

1. **Granularity matters**: Moving from 4 to 60 segments unlocked 6× better targeting
2. **Speed wins**: Real-time recommendations beat batch campaigns by 3×
3. **Test everything**: A/B testing revealed surprising segment preferences
4. **Mobile-first**: 70%+ traffic from mobile made responsive design critical
