## The Challenge

A major utility provider was struggling with:
- **Fragmented data**: 25+ source systems with no unified customer view
- **Generic outreach**: One-size-fits-all communication failing to resonate
- **Flat retention**: Customer churn remained stubbornly high
- **Missed opportunities**: Unable to identify and act on customer needs proactively

The executive team knew they needed to move from batch-and-blast campaigns to intelligent, personalized engagement—but their data infrastructure made this impossible.

## Our Approach

We took an integrated approach combining strategy, data engineering, and AI:

### 1. Data Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Mapped all 25+ customer data sources
- Designed a unified customer data model
- Built real-time data pipelines
- Established data quality monitoring

### 2. Analytics & Insights (Weeks 5-8)
- Created 500+ customer metrics across behavior, preferences, and lifecycle
- Developed predictive models for churn risk, upsell propensity, and channel preference
- Built customer segmentation with 60+ micro-segments

### 3. Next Best Action Engine (Weeks 9-12)
- Designed NBA decision framework with business rules + ML
- Integrated with existing CRM and campaign management
- Created agent-facing dashboards with real-time recommendations
- Launched with 30+ prioritized actions (retention offers, product recommendations, service alerts)

## The Results

**4× improvement in targeted campaign success rates** compared to batch campaigns.

**+10% increase in active customers** within the first year of deployment.

**30+ high-value actions** identified and prioritized based on customer lifetime value impact.

**500+ unified customer metrics** enabling unprecedented personalization.
