## Client Context

A B2B company wanted to produce consistent video content but lacked the structure, editing capacity, and publishing workflow to sustain it.

## The Challenge

- **Inconsistent publishing schedule**
- **Lack of a visual identity** for the videos
- **Unoptimized video structure** (retention issues)
- **No cohesive editing style**
- **No insights** into performance

The goal: create a scalable content system, not just individual videos.

## What We Did

### 1. Editing & Styling
- Implemented a consistent editing style
- Added motion graphics, cuts, and pacing improvements
- Designed visual overlays and intro/outro sequences

### 2. Workflow Design
- Created a repeatable pipeline:  
  **Recording → Editing → Review → Export → Publish → Measure**
- Eliminated bottlenecks
- Enabled predictable publishing

### 3. Channel Optimization
- Improved titles, tags, descriptions
- Added thumbnails and metadata
- Set up retention-based structuring

### 4. Performance Tracking
- Built a simple analytics dashboard
- Measured retention, CTR, watch time

## The Result

The client now has:
- A reliable, repeatable publication system
- Higher viewer retention
- Professionally branded videos
- A stronger, more consistent YouTube presence

This showcases IE Global's ability to support growth and performance beyond pure engineering.
