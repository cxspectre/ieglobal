## 🎯 Why This Works

**Executive Buying Journey:**
1. **Strategy** - "Do they understand our business?"
2. **Build** - "Can they actually build it well?"
3. **Scale** - "Will it grow with us?"
4. **Sustain** - "Will they be here when we need them?"

**Each slide answers one critical question.**

**Each Slide Shows:**
- Eyebrow tag (small, white text)
- Bold headline (large, impactful)
- Subtitle paragraph (context, value)
- Custom CTA (different per slide)
